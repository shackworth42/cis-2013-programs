        <p>The Fibonacci sequence is a mathematical concept that involves a recursive formula, where each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. 
            This sequence has fascinated mathematicians and scientists for centuries due to its unique properties and applications in diverse fields, such as botany, music, and economics. 
            In nature, the Fibonacci sequence can be observed in the arrangement of leaves on a stem, the growth patterns of pinecones, and even in the spirals of galaxies. 
            Moreover, this sequence is also used in technical analysis to predict stock prices in financial markets.<br>
